## Features
- 2D game example.
- Visual neural network drawing.

## About Game
- Character can move up, down, right and left.
- Character must move to the center of the secure area in time.

## About Learning
Supervised learning: Targets are difference between secure area x position and character x position, and difference between secure area y position and character y position.

### Inputs
- character x position
- secure area x position
- character y position
- secure area y position

### Outputs
- velocity x
- velocity y
